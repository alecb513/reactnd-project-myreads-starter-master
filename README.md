# MyReads Project

MyReads is an introductory project for getting familiar with working with React JS.  Its functionality allows you to organize books in different categories, or shelves, and offers a search feature for finding new books to add to your shelves. 

## Functionality 

Each book comes with a green button that reviles a dropdown menu with options allowing you to change the shelf the books is currently on.  To find new books click the green button with the ‘plus’ icon to reveal a search bar.  To return to your ‘shelves’ use the back-arrow button on the left side of the search bar.

-In the terminal use npm start to setup the local host
-Click and search till your hearts content 

## Special Thanks
